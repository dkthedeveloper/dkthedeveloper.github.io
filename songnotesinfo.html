            <h2>Song Notes</h2>
            <p>
              Song Notes is an application I began developing in January of
              2023. Essentially, it is a note-taking application for
              songwriters. The idea was sparked when I noticed how one of my
              frequent music collaborators (D Smoke) would share ideas with me.
              When we would work on music together (mostly remotely), he would
              always send me a demo recording as well as the lyrics written out
              in a note. This allowed me to provide more comprehensive feedback,
              and improved workflow. I thought that other writers would find it
              helpful if there were a browser-based application that allowed
              other creatives to organize their ideas in this way. That is where
              the idea for “Song Notes” was born. I created a rough design of
              the user interface using Sketch, and began writing the code
              shortly thereafter.
            </p>
            <p>
              The application was developed using React.js (Create React App)
              for the front-end, Node.js and Express.js for the back-end server,
              and MongoDB for data storage. The project presented a few new
              challenges, one being recording audio in the browser. To simplify
              interacting with the Web Audio API, which can be a bit confusing,
              I implemented RecordRTC.js, part of the WebRTC JavaScript library
              for audio/video recording. Finding a working library required a
              lot of research, as most available libraries for recording browser
              audio rely on a method that was recently deprecated.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project pushed me to learn new skills, such as working with a
              Node.js runtime. It also allowed me to expand my knowlege of
              React, as well as introduced me to working with Blobs/binary data.
              Overall, the application allowed me to blend my creativity and
              technical ability in a way that solves a real-world problem.
              Currently, I am working on the back-end API to allow users to
              create accounts and save their sessions. In the meantime, I have
              made the front-end available for demo purposes.
