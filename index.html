        <h3><u>Bio</u></h3>
        <p>Donovan is a front-end developer based in Los Angeles, CA. Born in Baltimore, Donovan relocated to the west coast
          to pursue one of his passions of producing music.</p>
          <p> After working as a music producer for over 10 years, Donovan saw 
          how intertwined the worlds of music and technology have become. This sparked a curiosity and an interest in gaining 
          the skills to be able to contribute to the growing technological revolution. That's where <a href="https://kenzie.snhu.edu/" id="kenzielink">Kenzie Academy</a> came in.</p>
          <p> 
           As a part of Kenzie Academy's Spring '22 Web Development cohort,
          Donovan has gained proficiency in web app building essentials (<em>HTML5, CSS,</em> and <em>JavaScript</em>). Currently, his goal is to
          work on challenging projects and continue to grow as a developer.
